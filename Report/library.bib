abstract = {This engineering brief explores the perceived effects and characteristics of impulse responses (IRs) generated using a custom, hybrid, geometric reverb algorithm. The algorithm makes use of a well known Image Source Method (ISM) and Ray Tracing methods. ISM is used to render the early reflections to a specified order whilst ray tracing renders the remaining reflections. IRs rendered at varying ISM orders appear to exhibit differences in perceptual characteristics, particularly in the early portion. To understand these characteristics, an elicitation test based was devised in order to acquire terms for the different characteristics. These terms were grouped in order to provide attributes for future grading tests.},

abstract = {This thesis describes a system that can be used for the decoding of a three dimensional audio recording over headphones or two, or more, speakers. A literature review of psychoacoustics and a review (both historical and current) of surround sound systems is carried out. The need for a system which is platform independent is discussed, and the proposal for a system based on an amalgamation of Ambisonics, binaural and transaural reproduction schemes is given. In order for this system to function optimally, each of the three systems rely on providing the listener with the relevant psychoacoustic cues. The conversion from a five speaker ITU array to binaural decode is well documented but pair-wise panning algorithms will not produce the correct lateralisation parameters at the ears of a centrally seated listener. Although Ambisonics has been well researched, no one has, as yet, produced a psychoacoustically optimised decoder for the standard irregular five speaker array as specified by the ITU as the original theory, as proposed by Gerzon and Barton (1992) was produced (known as a Vienna decoder), and example solutions given, before the standard had been decided on. In this work, the original work by Gerzon and Barton (1992) is analysed, and shown to be suboptimal, showing a high/low frequency decoder mismatch due to the method of solving the set of non-linear simultaneous equations.},

@article{Bilbao2013,
abstract = {Due to recent increases in computing power, room acoustics simulation in 3D using time stepping schemes is becoming a viable alternative to standard methods based on ray tracing and the image source method. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods, operating over regular grids, are perhaps the best known among such methods, which simulate the acoustic field in its entirety over the problem domain. In a realistic room acoustics setting, working over a regular grid is attractive from a computational standpoint, but is complicated by geometrical considerations, particularly when the geometry does not conform neatly to the grid, and those of boundary conditions which emulate the properties of real wall materials. Both such features may be dealt with through an appeal to methods operating over unstructured grids, such as finite volume methods, which reduce to FDTD when employed over regular grids. Through numerical energy analysis, such methods lead to direct stability conditions for complex problems, including convenient geometrical conditions at irregular boundaries. Simulation results are presented.},

@article{Tan2004,
abstract = {The goals of this study were to characterize and model the perception of nonlinearly distorted speech and music by hearing-impaired listeners. Hearing-impaired listeners were asked to rate the perceived quality of speech and music that had been subjected to various forms of nonlinear distortion, some of which are inherent to certain hearing aid designs including (1) hard and soft, symmetrical and asymmetrical clipping; (2) center clipping; (3) "full-range" distortion, produced by raising the absolute magnitude of the instantaneous amplitude of the signal to a power (8800;1), while preserving the signal of the amplitude; (4) automatic gain control (AGC); (5) output limiting. Stimuli were subjected to frequency-dependent amplification as prescribed by the "Cambridge formula" before presentation via Sennheiser HD580 earphones. The pattern of the rating was reasonably consistent across subjects with only two of ten subjects not making consistent ratings. The mean ratings were not lower with increasing amount of soft or center clipping or when the compression ratios of the AGC and output limiting were increased. The deleterious effects produced by these nonlinear distortions may have been offset by the beneficial effects of improving audibility and compensating for loudness recruitment.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the perception of dynamic range in the nonlinear system. The work is differentiated from the generic investigation of ‘sound quality' which is usually associated with studies of nonlinear distortion. The proposed hypothesis suggests that distortion products generated within the compressive type nonlinear system are able to act as loudness compensator for the associated amplitude compression in the loudness function. The hypothesis is tested using the Time-Varying Loudness model of Glasberg and Moore (2002) and further tested using AB scale hidden reference type listening test methods. The Loudness Overflow Effect (LOE) is introduced and bandwidth is shown to be a significant limiting factor. Results and immediate implications are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The Woodworth model and formula for interaural time difference is frequently used as a standard in physiological and psychoacoustical studies of binaural hearing for humans and other animals. It is a frequency-independent, ray-tracing model of a rigid spherical head that is expected to agree with the high-frequency limit of an exact diffraction model. The predictions by the Woodworth model for antipodal ears and for incident plane waves are here compared with the predictions of the exact model as a function of frequency to quantify the discrepancy when the frequency is not high. In a second calculation, the Woodworth model is extended to arbitrary ear angles, both for plane-wave incidence and for finite point-source distance. The extended Woodworth model leads to different formulas in six different regions defined by ear angle and source distance. It is noted that the characteristic cusp in Woodworth{\&}apos;s well-known function comes from ignoring the longer of the two paths around the head in circumstances when the longer path is actually important. This error can be readily corrected.},

abstract = {Investigation of wafer spatial variations is critical for semiconductor process/equipment optimization and circuit design. The objective of spatial variation study is to differentiate the systematic variation component from the random component. This is usually done by contrasting with a set of known systematic patterns based on engineering knowledge. However, there could exist unknown systematic components remaining in the unexplained residuals and overlooked by the conventional spatial variation study. In this paper, we develop a novel spatial variance spectrum (SVS) to analyze the systematic variations without any priori information of the systematic patterns. The SVS is a series of spatial variations over a range of spatial moving window sizes from the smallest spatial moving window consisting of only two metrology sites to the largest one covering all metrology sites of the entire wafer. The SVS can be used to characterize the wafer spatial variations and to detect existence of systematic variations by a proposed hypothesis test. We also propose an index to summarize from the SVS the systematic proportion of the spatial variation. The proposed test and index of systematic variations will be demonstrated and validated through both hypothetical examples and actual cases of wafer critical dimension (CD) metrology data.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genomic information is modulated by a variety ofepigenetic modifications that play both a direct role in establishing transcription profiles, modulation of DNA replication and repair processes and also indirect effects on the aforementioned processes through the organization of DNA architecture within the cell nucleus. Nowadays, the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating tissue-specific expression, genomic imprinting or X-chromosome inactivation is widely recognized. In addition, the key role of epigenetic modifications during cell differentiation and development has been highlighted by the identification of a variety of epigenetic alterations in human disease. Particular attention has been focused on the study of epigenetic alterations in cancer, which is the subject of intense multidisciplinary efforts and has an impact not only in understanding the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation but also in guiding the development ofnovel therapies for cancer treatment. In addition, a number of genetic disorders such as immunodeficiency-centromere instability-facial anomalies (ICF) or Rett syndromes are directly associated with defects in elements of the epigenetic machinery. More recently, epigenetic changes in cardiovascular, neurological and autoimmune disorders as well as in other genetically complex diseases have also started to emerge. All these examples illustrate the widespread association ofepigenetic alterations with disease and highlight the need of characterizing the range and extension of epigenetic changes to understand their contribution to fundamental human biological processes.},

As a direct time-domain simulation, suitable for large modeling regions, the technique seems a good brute force approach for solving room acoustic problems. Some attention is paid in this paper to a few of the key problems involved in applying FDTD: frequency-dependent boundary conditions, non-Cartesian grids, and numerical error. Possible applications are illustrated with an example. An interesting approach lies in using the FDTD simulation to adapt a digital filter to represent the acoustical transfer function from source to observer, as accurately as possible. The approximate digital filter can be used for auralization experiments.},

abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a deformable object bouncing on an oscillating plate and we propose to model its deformations. For this purpose, we use a spring linked to a damper. Elastic properties and viscous effects are taken into account. From the bouncing spring equations of motion, we emphasize the relevant parameters of the dynamics. We discuss the range of parameters in which elastic deformations do not influence the bouncing dynamics of this object and compare this behavior with the bouncing ball dynamics. By calculating the spring bouncing threshold, we evidence the effect of resonance and prove that elastic properties can make the bounce easier. This effect is for example encountered in the case of bouncing droplets. We also consider bifurcation diagrams in order to describe the consequences of a dependence on the frequency. Finally, hysteresis in the dynamics is presented. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

As existing modelling methods still need to be improved, it is of critical importance to focus on the human perception of the acoustic of the given space, rather than optimizing room acoustic parameters based only on objective measures. This work uses a much simplified representation of a space with the resulting computer model giving the capability to control all of the examined acoustic or simulation parameters independently. A 3D shoebox-shape room is created and a variety of factors are changed in order to investigate their relevance and influence on human perception. These results are obtained from listening tests and conclusions for the psychoacoustic perception of such a space are given.},

Surprisingly, we found no evidence of preference for the less compressed music. We also failed to find differences in ratings of perceived "depth" between the original and more compressed audio.

@article{Lee2010,
abstract = {An efficient reverberator structure is proposed for approximating measured reverberation. A fixed convolution matching the early portion of a measured impulse response is crossfaded with a switched convolution reverberator drawing its switched convolution section from the late-field of the measured impulse response. In this way, the early portion of the measured impulse response is precisely re- produced, and the late-field equalization and decay rates efficiently approximated. To use segments of the measured impulse response, the switched convolution structure is modified to include a normal- ization filter to account for the decay of the late-field between the nominal fixed/switched crossfade time and the time of the selected segment. Further, the measured impulse response late-field is ex- tended below its noise floor in anticipation of the normalization. This structure provides psychoacoustically accurate synthesis of the measured impulse response using less than half a second of convolution, irrespective of the length of the measured impulse re- sponse. In addition, the structure provides direct control over the equalization and late-field frequency dependent decay rate. Emu- lations of EMT 140 plate reverberator and marble lobby impulse responses are presented.},

The work is differentiated from the generic investigation of ‘sound quality' which is usually associated with studies of nonlinear distortion. The proposed hypothesis suggests that distortion products generated within the compressive type nonlinear system are able to act as loudness compensator for the associated amplitude compression in the loudness function. The hypothesis is tested using the Time-Varying Loudness model of Glasberg and Moore (2002) and further tested using AB scale hidden reference type listening test methods. The Loudness Overflow Effect (LOE) is introduced and bandwidth is shown to be a significant limiting factor. Results and immediate implications are briefly discussed.},

@article{Hansen,
abstract = {10.1. INTRODUCTION As with any occupational hazard, control technology should aim at reducing noise to acceptable levels by action on the work environment. Such action involves the implementation of any measure that will reduce noise being generated, and/or will reduce the noise transmission through the air or through the structure of the workplace. Such measures include modifications of the machinery, the workplace operations, and the layout of the workroom. In fact, the best approach for noise hazard control in the work environment, is to eliminate or reduce the hazard at its source of generation, either by direct action on the source or by its confinement. Practical considerations must not be overlooked; it is often unfeasible to implement a global control program all at once. The most urgent problems have to be solved first; priorities have to be set up. In certain cases, the solution may be found in a combination of measures which by themselves would not be enough; for example, to achieve part of the required reduction through environmental measures and to complement them with personal measures (e.g. wearing hearing protection for only 2-3 hours), bearing in mind that it is extremely difficult to make sure that hearing protection is properly fitted and properly worn. This chapter presents the principles of engineering control of noise, specific control measures and some examples. Reading of chapter 1 is indispensable for the understanding of this chapter. Note that many of the specific noise control measures described are intended as a rough guide only. Further information on the subject can be found in ISO 11690 and in the specialised literature. Also suppliers of equipment and noise control hardware can often provide helpful noise control advice. 10.2. NOISE CONTROL STRATEGIES (See ISO 11690) Prior to the selection and design of control measures, noise sources must be identified and the noise produced must be carefully evaluated. Procedures for taking noise measurements in the course of a noise survey are discussed in chapter 7.},

abstract = {The first artificial reverberation algorithms were proposed in the early 1960s, and new, improved algorithms are published regularly. These algorithms have been widely used in music production since the 1970s, and now find applications in new fields, such as game audio. This overview article provides a unified review of the various approaches to digital artificial reverberation. The three main categories have been delay networks, convolution-based algorithms, and physical room models. Delay-network and convolution techniques have been competing in popularity in the music technology field, and are often employed to produce a desired perceptual or artistic effect. In applications including virtual reality, predictive acoustic modeling, and computer-aided design of acoustic spaces, accuracy is desired, and physical models have been mainly used, although, due to their computational complexity, they are currently mainly used for simplified geometries or to generate reverberation impulse responses for use with a convolution method. With the increase of computing power, all these approaches will be available in real time. A recent trend in audio technology is the emulation of analog artificial reverberation units, such as spring reverberators, using signal processing algorithms. As a case study we present an improved parametric model for a spring reverberation unit.},

@article{Fallis2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes recent experimental work on nonlinear dynamical phenomena in gas discharge plasmas. As a relatively simple example, chaotic oscillations in low-pressure thermionic discharges are discussed in detail. Period doubling bifurcations and intermittency are clearly identified as standard routes to chaotic behaviour. Most of its dynamical features are well described by simple nonlinear oscillator models. In contrast, plasma waves are spatiotemporal phenomena and thus show a much richer dynamical behaviour. This is demonstrated for current-driven drift waves in a linear magnetized plasma. Probe arrays provide the required information about the time evolution of the azimuthal wave structure.},

The model consists of the tongue, hyoid bone, jaw, larynx complex, bilateral piriform fossae, and vocal tract wall that includes the hard palate, soft palate, pharyngeal wall. In this study, we generated a series of time-varying vocal tract shapes in simulating vowel-vowel (VV) sequence by the 3D articulatory model and analyzed their acoustic characteristics using the finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) method. Area functions (AF) showed that the vocal tract shapes vary smoothly frame by frame, while the transfer functions (TF) transit continuously from vowel to vowel for the first four formants. Acoustic roles of the piriform fossae were also examined. The piriform fossa generated two spectral d ips around 4 kHz in transfer function. Pressure distribution patterns at first four formant frequencies for vowel /a/were examined, which are consistent with previous studies. Experimental results showed that our physiological model can describe the details of the vocal tract.},

Currently the most common techniquesfor acoustic simulations draw on mesh-based methods such as theBoundary Element Method (BEM), Finite Differences Method (FD) and FiniteElement Method (FEM). Though many improvements have been made toeach class of methods during the last few years, theystill have their weaknesses. Difficulties arise as soon as inhomogeneousmedia, moving boundaries or aeroacoustic effects are involved. These problemsare either particularly hard to describe or cannot be simulatedwith some of these mesh-based methods. The investigation of SPHfor modeling sound propagation is carried out in order toassess its potential in relation to the limitations associated withthe existing simulation methods listed above.

abstract = {A single room impulse response can reveal information about the acoustics of a given space in both objective, and, when used for auralization, subjective terms. However, for additional spatial information, or more accurate and perceptually convincing auralization, multiple impulse responses are needed. Higher order Ambisonics is a robust means of capturing the spatial qualities of an acoustic space over multiple channels for decoding and rendering over many possible speaker layouts. A method for obtaining {\$}N{\$}th-order Ambisonic impulse responses from a room acoustic model, based on lower orders using differential microphone techniques is presented. This is tested using a third-order encoding of a 2-D finite difference time domain room acoustic simulation based on multiple circular arrays of receivers. Accurate channel directional profiles are obtained and results are verified in a series of listening tests comparing the localization of a sound source placed within the given simulation to the same source encoded directly. This generic encoding scheme can be applied to any room acoustic simulation technique where it is possible to obtain impulse responses across multiple receiver positions. Although the proposed method encompasses horizontal encoding only, it can also be applied directly in 3-D simulations where height information is not required in the final auralization.},

abstract = {The “direct-off-line” switchmode supply is so called because it takes its power input directly from the ac power lines, without using the rather large low-frequency (60 to 50 Hz) isolation transformer normally found in linear power supplies. Although the various switchmode conversion techniques are often very different in terms of circuit design, they have, over many years, developed very similar basic functional characteristics that have become generally accepted industry standards. Further, the need to satisfy various national and international safety, electromagnetic compatibility, and line transient requirements has forced the adoption of relatively standard techniques for track and component spacing, noise filter design, and transient protection. The prudent designer will be familiar with all these agency needs before proceeding with a design. Many otherwise sound designs have failed as a result of their inability to satisfy safety agency standards. Many of the requirements outlined in this section will be common to all switching sup-plies, irrespective of the design strategy or circuit. Although the functions tend to remain the same for all units, the circuit techniques used to obtain them may be quite different. There are many ways of meeting these needs, and there will usually be a best approach for a particular application. The designer must also consider all the minor facets of the specification before decid-ing on a design strategy. Failure to consider at an early stage some very minor system requirement could completely negate a design approach—for example, power good and power failure indicators and signals, which require an auxiliary supply irrespective of the converter action, would completely negate a design approach which does not provide this auxiliary supply when the converter is inhibited! It can often prove to be very difficult to provide for some minor neglected need at the end of the design and development exercise. The remainder of Chap. 1 gives an overview of the basic input and output functions most often required by the user or specified by national or international standards. They will assist in the checking or development of the initial specification, and all should be considered before moving to the design stage.},

However, loudspeaker nonlinear distortion is often not taken into account by room correction products and this thesis investigates how distortion can be assessed. The theory of how distortion is produced in loudspeakers and the criteria that governs whether it is perceptible or not is reviewed. Two Matlab graphi- cal user interfaces were developed, one for measuring distortion in loudspeakers and one implementing an algorithm that varies the low frequency cut-off of a loudspeaker depending on the volume level, thus increasing the bass extension possible with small loudspeakers. This method gives good subjective results with small loudspeakers.},

Mainly because it is a time-domain method, it has some specific advantages. The basic formulation of the FDTD method uses an analytical grid for the discretization of an unknown field. This is a major disadvantage. In this paper, FDTD equations that allow us to use a nonuniform grid are derived. With this grid, tilted and curved boundaries can be described more easily. This gives a better accuracy to CPU-resource ratio in a number of circumstances. The paper focuses on the new formulation and its accuracy. The problem of automatically generating the mesh in a general situation is not addressed. Simulations using quasi-Cartesian grids are compared to Cartesian grid results.},

@article{Zhang2010,
abstract = {The explosion of interest in metamaterials is due to the dramatically increased manipulation ability over light as well as sound waves. This material research was stimulated by the opportunity to develop an artificial media with negative refractive index and the application in superlens which allows super-resolution imaging. High-resolution acoustic imaging techniques are the essential tools for nondestructive testing and medical screening. However, the spatial resolution of the conventional acoustic imaging methods is restricted by the incident wavelength of ultrasound. This is due to the quickly fading evanescent fields which carry the subwavelength features of objects. By focusing the propagating wave and recovering the evanescent field, a flat lens with negative-index can potentially overcome the diffraction limit. We present the first experimental demonstration of focusing ultrasound waves through a flat acoustic metamaterial lens composed of a planar network of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators. We observed a tight focus of half-wavelength in width at 60.5 KHz by imaging a point source. This result is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulation by transmission line model in which we derived the effective mass density and compressibility. This metamaterial lens also displays variable focal length at different frequencies. Our experiment shows the promise of designing compact and light-weight ultrasound imaging elements. ii Moreover, the concept of metamaterial extends far beyond negative refraction, rather giving enormous choice of material parameters for different applications. One of the most interesting examples these years is the invisible cloak. Such a device is proposed to render the hidden object undetectable under the flow of light or sound, by guiding and controlling the wave path through an engineered space surrounding the object. However, the cloak designed by transformation optics usually calls for a highly anisotropic metamaterial, which make the experimental studies remain challenging. We present here the first practical realization of a low-loss and broadband acoustic cloak for underwater ultrasound. This metamaterial cloak is constructed with a network of acoustic circuit elements, namely serial inductors and shunt capacitors. Our experiment clearly shows that the acoustic cloak can effectively bend the ultrasound waves around the hidden object, with reduced scattering and shadow. Due to the non-resonant nature of the building elements, this low loss ({\~{}}6dB/m) cylindrical cloak exhibits excellent invisibility over a broad frequency range from 52 to 64 kHz in the measurements. The low visibility of the cloaked object for underwater ultrasound shed a light on the fundamental understanding of manipulation, storage and control of acoustic waves. Furthermore, our experimental study indicates that this design approach should be scalable to different acoustic frequencies and offers the possibility for a variety of devices based on coordinate transformation.},

Problematically, such NLD-related distortions can also form perceptual distortion. Earlier studies reveal that although objective measurement scores quantify bass enhancement and harmonic distortion, there is weak correlationwith subjective perception. An in-depth sub- jective study is presented on NLD-specific distortion linked to perception and bass-intensity enhancement and then extended to correlate the Rnonlin distortion model to subjective data. Nonlinear regression computes Rnonlin-equation coefficients to enable a metric for audibility of NLD-dependent distortion. Recommendations follow for NLD sets that achieve good bass performance with low perceived distortion.},

Conventional methods for the assessment of room acoustics model the sound propagation in analogy to the propagation of light. More advanced computational methods rely on the numerical solution of the wave equation. A recently presented method is based on multidimensional wave digital principles. It allows a physically exact numerical modelling of the relevant acoustical effects and yields robust algorithms. This contribution presents a new foundation of the multidimensional wave digital principle as applied to room acoustics. It starts from the first principles of physics. From there, the derivation of the algorithm only involves basic knowledge of numerical mathematics, linear algebra, and multidimensional system theory. An example for the simulation of dynamic three-dimensional sound propagation demonstrates the capability of the method ER -},

The image positions computed by the method can be reduced to the directional impulse respones in order to create audible  simulations of the concert hall. Also, the image model can provide insight into the fundamental acoustical properties of different concert hall geometries. For example, the extended image model demonstrates that rectangular halls have an advantage over fan-shaped halls with regard to spatial impression. We also show why the image model has fundamental advantages over another popular modeling technique, ray tracing.},

Modern digital equipment makes measurements possible with very good reli- ability and background noise immunity. Broadband frequency curves or impulse responses are usually filtered to enable parameter evaluation in octave or one-third octave bands. Impulse responses in small rooms with very Iow reverberation times can be distorted by the application of band filters. However, the objective characterization of the subjective listening effect of single number quantities in frequency bands is quite different from the well- known criteria in room acoustics: reverberation time, clarity, center time, lateral energy fraction, and so forth. In small rooms, other criteria are relevant, particularly the temporal structure of the early reflections, the cut-off fre- quency of the room, the distribution of room resonances, and the corresponding effect of sound coloration.},

Hearing-impaired listeners were asked to rate the perceived quality of speech and music that had been subjected to various forms of nonlinear distortion, some of which are inherent to certain hearing aid designs including (1) hard and soft, symmetrical and asymmetrical clipping; (2) center clipping; (3) "full-range" distortion, produced by raising the absolute magnitude of the instantaneous amplitude of the signal to a power (8800;1), while preserving the signal of the amplitude; (4) automatic gain control (AGC); (5) output limiting. Stimuli were subjected to frequency-dependent amplification as prescribed by the "Cambridge formula" before presentation via Sennheiser HD580 earphones. The pattern of the rating was reasonably consistent across subjects with only two of ten subjects not making consistent ratings. The mean ratings were not lower with increasing amount of soft or center clipping or when the compression ratios of the AGC and output limiting were increased. The deleterious effects produced by these nonlinear distortions may have been offset by the beneficial effects of improving audibility and compensating for loudness recruitment.

The audibility of the all-pass component is tested in a three-alternative forced choice experiment. Results show that a pair of head-related transfer functions can be represented by its minimum phase components if the appropriate interaural time difference is applied. The interaural time difference is found as the interaural group delay difference at 0 Hz determined from the excess phase (linear phase and all-pass) components.},

abstract = {This thesis discusses room acoustics modeling and the basics and drawbacks of different methods. Then it concentrates on the ray-tracing algorithm, and offers the author's implementation of the method and an evaluation of its accuracy when comparing modeled sound decays and predicted acoustical parameters with the corresponding measured data in three different enclosures. First, a general introduction of the sound propagation principles and a discussion of the state of the art in room acoustics modeling are given. How to implement the ray-tracing algorithm is explained, not only the way adopted by the author but also other possibilities which could improve accuracy. That is followed by a geometrical and an acoustical description of the three studied enclosures, and the comparison of the modeled and measured data. Sound pressure level is predicted with very good accuracy, while reverberation time is more contradictory due to the negation of the wave nature of sound which is inherent in the model. The paper ends with a discussion of the results' accuracy and the reasons for similarities and/or differences.},

Since in practice many loudspeaker line arrays are not actually straight, expressions are provided for curved (arc), J, and progressive line arrays.

@misc{Strogatz1994,
abstract = {This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level. It is also ideal for the scientist who has not had formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desires to begin informal study. The prerequisites are multivariable calculus and introductory physics.},

They make it possible to run certain tasks orders of magnitude faster than what is possible with a cen- tral processing unit (CPU). One such case is simulation of room acoustics with wave-based modeling techniques. In this paper we show that it is possible to run room acoustic simulations with a finite-difference time-domain model in real-time for a modest-size geometry up to 7kHz sampling rate. For a 10{\%} maximum disper- sion error limit this means that our system can be used for real- time auralization up to 1.5kHz. In addition, the system is able to handle several simultaneous sound sources and a moving listener with no additional cost. The results of this study include perfor- mance comparison of different schemes showing that the interpo- lated wideband scheme is able to handle in real-time 1.4 times the bandwidth of the standard rectilinear scheme with the same maxi- mum dispersion error.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with pain, reduced grip strength, loss of range of motion and joint stiffness leading to impaired hand function and difficulty with daily activities. The effectiveness of different rehabilitation interventions on specific treatment goals has not yet been fully explored. The objective of this systematic review is to provide evidence based knowledge on the treatment effects of different rehabilitation interventions for specific treatment goals for hand OA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A computerized literature search of Medline, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ISI Web of Science, the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and SCOPUS was performed. Studies that had an evidence level of 2b or higher and that compared a rehabilitation intervention with a control group and assessed at least one of the following outcome measures - pain, physical hand function or other measures of hand impairment - were included. The eligibility and methodological quality of trials were systematically assessed by two independent reviewers using the PEDro scale. Treatment effects were calculated using standardized mean difference and 95{\%} confidence intervals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Ten studies, of which six were of higher quality (PEDro score {\textgreater}6), were included. The rehabilitation techniques reviewed included three studies on exercise, two studies each on laser and heat, and one study each on splints, massage and acupuncture. One higher quality trial showed a large positive effect of 12-month use of a night splint on hand pain, function, strength and range of motion. Exercise had no effect on hand pain or function although it may be able to improve hand strength. Low level laser therapy may be useful for improving range of motion. No rehabilitation interventions were found to improve stiffness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There is emerging high quality evidence to support that rehabilitation interventions can offer significant benefits to individuals with hand OA. A summary of the higher quality evidence is provided to assist with clinical decision making based on current evidence. Further high-quality research is needed concerning the effects of rehabilitation interventions on specific treatment goals for hand OA.},

However, previous two-dimensional studies have noted that increasing the PML loss factor does not monotonically improve the PML's performance. This paper evaluates the PML in three-dimensional FDTD acoustic simulations. It confirms the existence of an optimum loss factor, with higher values degrading PML performance. An empirical formula is offered for estimating the optimum loss factor for a linear or a quadratic profile, that depends on the PML depth, sound speed, and grid resolution.},

Our study analyzed the long-term results and patient satisfaction following a percutaneous release in 30 joints after a mean follow-up period of 34 months. In one half of cases the preoperative joint flexion deformity was reduced from 78° to 34°. The best results were observed in patients with osteoarthritis and stiff, immobilized joints. In patients with inflammatory arthritides, marked intraoperative correction was maintained rarely, joint contractures recurred early, and patients were unsatisfied. There were no intraoperative complications. Percutaneous release of the accessory collateral ligaments can produce a long lasting correction of the joint contracture, but careful patient selection and strict postoperative rehabilitation are essential for favorable outcome.},

abstract = {The following paper describes a work which sought to revive and investigate the soundscape of a 14th century Abbey. Geometric room acoustic modelling methods were employed to realise this aim and particular attention was given to monitoring the influ- ence of the level of geometrical detailing on acoustical character- istics. Three virtual acoustic models, of varying detail, were con- structed and simulated in order to obtain room impulse responses which were then harnessed for analysis and the creation of au- ralizations. The results given in this document were obtained through direct examination of impulse responses gathered and subjective testing. Reverberation times were shown to be more or less consistent at high frequencies in all three models and in- creasingly dissimilar as frequency decreases. Subjective testing was employed to gain insight into the audibility of the contrast in acoustical qualities possessed by each model. The conclusions drawn from analysis are, in part, supported by the subjective test- ing results},

Improved approaches to efficient binaural synthesis are discussed, whereby interaural time differences are explicitly controlled.

The new method is the extension of the classic auralization process based on the linear convolution of the "dry" original signal with the impulse response of the system. The extension allows for the emulation of non-linear systems, characterized in terms of harmonic distortion at several orders. The work first presents the mathematical framework of the proposed implementation, then it is shown how a not linear system can be experimentally characterized by a new measurement method of multiple impulse responses at various harmonic orders, and finally it is shown how these impulse responses can be employed in a multiple convolution process: an experimental demonstration is given of the similarity of the numerically processed sound with the live recording coming from a highly distorting device.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been growing interest in modeling sound propagation in complex, three-dimensional (3D) virtual environments. With diverse applications for the military, the gaming industry, psychoacoustics researchers, architectural acousticians, and others, advances in computing power and 3D audio-rendering techniques have driven research and development aimed at closing the gap between the auralization and visualization of virtual spaces. To this end, this thesis focuses on improving the physical and perceptual realism of sound-field simulations in virtual environments through advances in edge-diffraction modeling. To model sound propagation in virtual environments, acoustical simulation tools commonly rely on geometrical-acoustics (GA) techniques that assume asymptotically high frequencies, large flat surfaces, and infinitely thin ray-like propagation paths. Such techniques can be augmented with diffraction modeling to compensate for the effect of surface size on the strength and directivity of a reflection, to allow for propagation around obstacles and into shadow zones, and to maintain sound-field continuity across reflection and shadow boundaries. Using a time-domain, line-integral formulation of the Biot-Tolstoy-Medwin (BTM) diffraction expression, this thesis explores various aspects of diffraction calculations for virtual-acoustic simulations. Specifically, we first analyze the periodic singularity of the BTM integrand and describe the relationship between the singularities and higher-order reflections within wedges with open angle less than 180 degrees. Coupled with analytical approximations for the BTM expression, this analysis allows for accurate numerical computations and a continuous sound field in the vicinity of an arbitrary wedge geometry insonified by a point source. Second, we describe an edge-subdivision strategy that allows for fast diffraction calculations with low error relative to a numerically more accurate solution. Third, to address the considerable increase in propagation paths due to diffraction, we describe a simple procedure for identifying and culling insignificant diffraction components during a virtual-acoustic simulation. Finally, we present a novel method to find GA components using diffraction parameters that ensures continuity at reflection and shadow boundaries.},

The goal of this study is to report the results of early definitive treatment in extra-articular metacarpal and proximal phalangeal fractures due to low velocity gunshot wounds and to analyse their outcomes. A retrospective analysis of 51 metacarpal and 41 proximal phalangeal fractures of 76 patients due to low velocity gunshot wounds treated between January 2001 and December 2004 was carried out. We applied acute fixation in the first 24 hours. The patients were evaluated with total active motion scores, radiographic control, complication rate and the need for revision surgery. The infection frequency was 10.5{\%} and the need for a revision surgery was 7{\%}. The plate fixation group had significantly higher total active motion scores than the external fixation group. The K wire group had the highest revision rate. The bone grafting group was associated with good total active motion scores and low complication rates. The majority of the low velocity gunshot injuries are surgically clean wounds which allow not only early fracture fixation, but also early bone grafting and soft tissue reconstruction. Plate and screw fixation is associated with significantly better functional outcomes than the minimal fixation group.},

abstract = {A variety of methods are available for implementing time-varying digital filters for musical applications. The considerations for mu- sical applications differ from those of other applications, such as speech coding. This domain requires realtime parametric control of a filter such as an equalizer, allowing parameters to vary each sample, e.g. by user interaction, a low-frequency oscillator (LFO), or an envelope. It is desirable to find a filter structure that is time- varying stable, artifact-free, computationally efficient, easily sup- ports arbitrary filter shapes, and yields sensible intermediate filter shapes when interpolating coefficients. It is proposed to use the state variable filter (SVF) for this purpose. A novel proof of its stable time-varying behavior is presented. Equations are derived for matching common equalizer filter shapes, as well as any z- domain transfer function, making the SVF suitable for efficiently implementing any recursive filter. The SVF is compared to state of the art filter structures in an objective evaluation and a subjective listening test. The results confirm that the SVF has good audio quality, while supporting the aforementioned advantageous quali- ties in a time-varying digital filter for music. They also show that a class of time-varying filter techniques useful for speech coding are unsuitable for musical applications.},

While interactive geometrical approaches can be used for more accurate acoustical modeling, the increased authoring complexity and the additional cost of geometrical calculations still appears to overshadow their potential benefits. This paper presents solutions to integrate off-line geometrical acoustic modeling in game environments. By pre-computing image-source gradients for early reflections and directional decay profiles, we can generate location dependent reverberation effects without storing or accessing the actual geometry at run-time. We render such reverberation effects using a frequency-domain scalable processing approach. In this context, we introduce an efficient prioritization scheme and evaluate alternative transforms for late reverberation processing. Our pipeline enables fine-grain rendering of distance and surface proximity effects and modeling of both outdoor and coupled indoor spaces with arbitrary reverberation decay profiles},

abstract = {This paper introduces a technique for time-domain electromagnetic inverse scattering based upon the use of a two-dimensional, finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) forward scattering field representation in numerical feedback loop with a nonlinear optimization routine. Causality is exploited to reconstruct the actual target surface contour in a sequential and cumulative manner as the illuminating wavefront sweeps across the target. This approach appears to require a minimum amount of scattered field information. A number of examples are reported where the only data needed is the time waveform of a scattered pulse for the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization case, observed at just a single point in the near field. These examples include the reconstruction of two-dimensional conducting and homogeneous dielectric target shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. A dielectric target with reentrant features, resembling the letter "J" is also reconstructed from a single point observation. The effects of measurement signal-to-noise ratio upon this inverse-scattering technique are determined via numerical experiments. These effects are discussed in two contexts: 1) probability of exact reconstruction vs. signal-to-noise ratio, and 2) sensitivity of reconstructions to noise. It is shown that, even at low signal-to-noise ratios (where the probability of exact reconstruction is also low), the imperfectly-reconstructed targets retain many of the distinguishing features of the original target. This indicates that the reconstruction process is quite robust relative to noise.

abstract = {A single room impulse response can reveal information about the acoustics of a given space in both objective, and, when used for auralization, subjective terms. However, for additional spatial information, or more accurate and perceptually convincing auralization, multiple impulse responses are needed. Higher order Ambisonics is a robust means of capturing the spatial qualities of an acoustic space over multiple channels for decoding and rendering over many possible speaker layouts. A method for obtaining {\$}N{\$}th-order Ambisonic impulse responses from a room acoustic model, based on lower orders using differential microphone techniques is presented. This is tested using a third-order encoding of a 2-D finite difference time domain room acoustic simulation based on multiple circular arrays of receivers. Accurate channel directional profiles are obtained and results are verified in a series of listening tests comparing the localization of a sound source placed within the given simulation to the same source encoded directly. This generic encoding scheme can be applied to any room acoustic simulation technique where it is possible to obtain impulse responses across multiple receiver positions. Although the proposed method encompasses horizontal encoding only, it can also be applied directly in 3-D simulations where height information is not required in the final auralization.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the available evidence (published and unpublished) on the relation between loudness and stimulus intensity. The evidence suggests that for the typical listener the loudness L of a 1000-cycle tone can be approximated by a power function of intensity I, of which the exponent is log102. The equation is: L = kI0.3. Intensity here is assumed to be proportional to the square of the sound pressure. In terms of sones, where 1 sone is the loudness produced by a tone at 40 db above the standard reference level, the equation for loudness L as a function of the number of decibels N becomes: logL = 0.03N−1.2. Otherwise said, a loudness ratio of 2:1 is produced by a pair of stimuli that differ by 10 db, and this relation appears to hold over the entire range of audible intensities. At low levels of intensity, the loudness of white noise grows more rapidly than the loudness of a 1000-cycle tone, but above the level of approximately 50 db the two loudnesses remain more nearly proportional. The suggestion is made that for all levels greater than 50 db the loudness of continuous noises may be calculated from the equation: logL = 0.03N+S, where S is a spectrum parameter to be determined empirically.},

abstract = {The mixing time of room impulse responses denotes the moment when the diffuse re- verberation tail begins. A diffuse (“mixed”) sound field can physically be defined by (1) equidistribution of acoustical energy and (2) a uniform acoustical energy flux over the com- plete solid angle. Accordingly, the perceptual mixing time could be regarded as the moment when the diffuse tail cannot be distinguished from that of any other position or listener's orien- tation in the room. This, for instance, provides an opportunity for reducing the part of binaural room impulse responses that has to be updated dynamically inVirtual Acoustic Environments. Several authors proposed model- and signal-based estimators for the mixing time in rooms. Our study aims at an evaluation of all measures as predictors of a perceptual mixing time. Therefore, we collected binaural impulse response data sets with an adjustable head and torso simulator for a representative sample of rectangular shaped rooms. Altering the transition time into a homogeneous diffuse tail in real time in an adaptive, forced-choice listening test, we determined just audible perceptual mixing times.We evaluated the performance of all potential predictors by linear regression and finally obtained formulae to estimate the perceptual mixing time from measured impulse responses or physical properties of the room.},

abstract = {The paper describes a new determination of the equal-loudness relations for pure tones in free-field conditions which has been carried out at the National Physical Laboratory as a result of requests from organizations interested in various aspects of the acoustics of hearing. The equal-loudness contours are of considerable importance in this field, being fundamental to a proper understanding of aural judgments of the loudness of sounds of all kinds. They are also concerned in numerous practical applications in the study of noise. The first set of contours for free-field conditions was given by Fletcher and Munson in 1933, and a second determination was carried out by Churcher and King in 1937, but these two investigations showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram. The present work has been carried out on a more extensive scale, using a large team of otologically normal persons, and new techniques have been introduced enabling reliable measurements to be made over a wider range of intensity than has hitherto been possible. The new results cover a range of frequency of from 25 to 15 000 c/s and of sound pressure level up to about 130 dB relative to 0.000 2 dyn/cm2. The data show a greater degree of regularity than the former results, and allow the equivalent loudness of a pure tone of any frequency to be expressed by formulae quadratic in the sound pressure level, the coefficients varying smoothly with frequency. The results include a new determination of the normal threshold of hearing in free field, which is highly consistent with the equal-loudness contours. At frequencies above 1000 c/s account needs to be taken of variations due to the age of the observers, which become of particular importance at the upper end of the frequency range. The new results have indicated the causes of some of the discordant features in the earlier determinations and it is hoped that the work will facilitate agreement on a standard set of equal-loudness contours. On account of its relevance to noise measurement, some extension to equal-loudness relations for bands of noise is being undertaken.},

abstract = {To increase the survival rates of patients with breast cancer, an ultrasound imaging system must detect tumors when they are small, with a diameter of 5 mm or less. This requires an understanding of how propagation of ultrasound energy is affected by the complex structure of the breast. In this paper, a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is developed to simulate ultrasound propagation in a two-dimensional model of the human breast. The FDTD simulations make it possible to better understand the behavior of an ultrasound signal in the breast. For example, here the simulations are used to investigate the effect of fat lobes adjacent to the skin layer in a simple breast model. Experimental work performed at the University of Pennsylvania has shown that strong refraction caused by the fat lobes results in nulls in the forward transmitted field. This result was duplicated with the FDTD simulations, and it was shown that the effect of refraction is clearly evident for energy exiting the breast. The existence of strong refraction has a significant impact on ultrasound imaging since it implies that an imaging method based on a weak scattering assumption is unlikely to work well.},

abstract = {Previously we described a model for calculating the loudness of steady sou nds from their spectrum. Here a new version of the model is presented, which uses a waveform as its input. The stages of the model are as follows. (a) A finite impulse response filter representing transfer through the outer and middle ear. (b) Calculation of the short-term spectrum using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). To give adequate spectral resolution at low frequencies, combined with adequate temporal resolution at high frequencies, six FFTs are calculated in parallel, using longer signal segments for low frequencies and shorter segments for higher frequencies. (c) Calculation of an excitation pauern from the physical spectrum. (d) Transformation of the excitation pattern to a specific loudness pattern. (e) Determination of the area under the specific loudness pattern. This gives a value for the "instantaneous" loudness. The short-term perceived loudness is calculated from the instantaneous loudness using an averaging mechanism similar to an automatic gain control system, with attack and release times. Finally the overall loudness impression is calculated from the short-term loudness using a similar averaging mechanism, but with longer attack and release times. The new model gives very similar predictions to our earlier model for steady sounds. In addition, it can predict the loudness of brief sounds as a function of duration and the overall loudness of sounds that are amplitude modulated at various rates.},

abstract = {1 The guide aims to help those who organise music events so that the events run safely. The event organiser, whether an individual, collective or local authority, has prime responsibility for protecting the health, safety and welfare of everyone working at, or attending, the event. 2 The guide brings together information needed by event organisers, their contractors and employees to help them satisfy the requirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSW Act) and associated regulations. It will also enable organisers to understand the needs of others concerned with events, such as the local authority and emergency services, with whom they will need to co-operate. 3 The guide makes clear what is required and why it is necessary or sensible to do this. The guide does not replace the need for event organisers to seek advice from other sources and particularly for consultation with local authorities and emergency services. 4 As well as event organisers, others will find the guide useful, eg local authorities, health and safety enforcement officers, emergency services, contractors and subcontractors working at the event. The guide provides basic standards and safety measures through which it is hoped to encourage a consistency of approach while leaving scope for flexibility, taking into account the nature and size of the event. In 1993, HSE, in conjunction with the Home Office and the Scottish Office, published The guide to health, safety and welfare at pop concerts and other similar events. The publication was well received and was adopted as the standard for planning and managing health and safety at these events. In the light of changes to health and safety law, and the continuing development of best practice by the event industry, the guide has been reviewed and revised. The advice in this publication has been tried and tested and lays down a firm foundation on which to organise health and safety at music events. Many of the chapters can be applied to other types of event which, although not necessarily having a musical theme, share some of the common characteristics of music events. This publication will enable event organisers, local authorities, the emergency services and HSE to work together to improve event safety. Their commitment to the production of this guide will ensure that health and safety remains a priority and that all involved will be able to continue to enjoy these events in safety. This guide has been written in consultation with an event industry working group and with the co-operation of a great many people. All contributors, including the members of the working group, are listed at the back of the publication in the Acknowledgements section. I am grateful to them for the time, knowledge and expertise which was given freely and without which, this guide would not be possible.

This can take every detail of the acoustic space into account, including the speaker or headphone-to-ear transfer function.

abstract = {When a sound producing device such as insert earphones or a hearing aid is sealed in the ear canal, the fact that only a tiny segment of the sound wave can exist in this small volume at any given instant, produces an oscillation of the static pressure in the ear canal. This effect can greatly boosts the SPL in the ear canal, especially at low frequencies, a phenomena which we call Trapped Volume Insertion Gain (TVIG). In this study the TVIG has been found by numerical modeling as well as direct measurements using a Zwislocki coupler and the ear of a human subject, to be as much as 50dB greater than sound pressures typically generated while listening to sounds in an open environment. Even at moderate listening volumes, the TVIG can increase the low frequency SPL in the ear canal to levels where they produce excursions of the tympanic membrane that are 100 to 1000 times greater than in normal open-ear hearing. Additionally, the high SPL at low frequencies in the trapped volume of the ear canal, can easily exceed the threshold necessary to trigger the Stapedius reflex, a stiffing response of the middle ear, which reduces its sensitivity, and may lead to audio fatigue. The addition of a compliant membrane covered vent in the sound tube of an insert ear tip was found to reduce the TVIG by up to 20 dB, such that the Stapedius reflex would likely not be triggered.},

abstract = {A well established method for estimating the shape of the auditory filter is based on the measurement of the threshold of a sinusoidal signal in a notched-noise masker, as a function of notch width. To measure the asymmetry of the filter, the notch has to be placed both symmetrically and asymmetrically about the signal frequency. In previous work several simplifying assumptions and approximations were made in deriving auditory filter shapes from the data. In this paper we describe modifications to the fitting procedure which allow more accurate derivations. These include: 1) taking into account changes in filter bandwidth with centre frequency when allowing for the effects of off-frequency listening; 2) correcting for the non-flat frequency response of the earphone; 3) correcting for the transmission characteristics of the outer and middle ear; 4) limiting the amount by which the centre frequency of the filter can shift in order to maximise the signal-to-masker ratio. In many cases, these modifications result in only small changes to the derived filter shape. However, at very high and very low centre frequencies and for hearing-impaired subjects the differences can be substantial. It is also shown that filter shapes derived from data where the notch is always placed symmetrically about the signal frequency can be seriously in error when the underlying filter is markedly asymmetric. New formulae are suggested describing the variation of the auditory filter with frequency and level. The implications of the results for the calculation of excitation patterns are discussed and a modified procedure is proposed. The appendix lists FORTRAN computer programs for deriving auditory filter shapes from notched-noise data and for calculating excitation patterns. The first program can readily be modified so as to derive auditory filter shapes from data obtained with other types of maskers, such as rippled noise. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Rife (RPG Diffusor Systems, 651-C Commerce Drive, Upper Marlboro, MD 20774) pdantonio@rpginc.com and brife@rpginc.com For over 100 years, the acoustical industry has measured and characterized sound absorption. And yet, standard meas-urements of the random incidence absorption coefficient, according to ISO 354 and ASTM C423-09, are still inaccurate and lack reproducibility among labs. All measurements and predictions rely on the concept of a diffuse sound field, which is yet to be fully characterized in the standards. Research is underway to improve accuracy by replacing traditional hang-ing diffusors with boundary mounted diffusors, to allow proper determination of the rev room's surface area and volume, evaluating edge diffraction, replacing Sabine with Eyring, etc.. Calibration methods using an absorptive or reflective refer-ence are also being evaluated to improve reproducibility. This author favors the use of a reflective reference, as this is cur-rently being used in ISO 179497-1 and ISO 17497-2 and reproducibility is found to be quite good at various scales among different labs. The field of measuring and characterizing scattered sound is in its infancy by comparison, yet in the past three decades much progress has been made. Two standards have emerged for measuring scattering (ISO 17497-1) and diffusion (ISO-17497-2) and the current state of the art for both will be reviewed. While much progress has been made in measuring and characterizing scattering surfaces, we still need to develop a relationship between these material metrics and a room property, which we can call diffusivity. This paper is intended to be a tutorial on the evolution and current state of the art.},

@article{Lohmiller1998,
abstract = {This paper derives new results in nonlinear system analysis using methods in- spired from fluid mechanics and differential geometry. Based on a differential analy- sis of convergence, these resultsmay be viewed as generalizing the classical Krasovskii theorem, and, more loosely, linear eigenvalue analysis. A central feature is that con- vergence and limit behavior are in a sense treated separately, leading to significant conceptual simplifications. The approach is illustrated by controller and observer designs for simple physical examples.},

@article{Mokhtari2011,
abstract = {Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) acoustic simulation was used to calculate Pinna-Related Transfer Functions (PRTFs) of the KEMAR manikin's DB60 pinna. A baseline set of 25 PRTFs were first calculated at regular intervals of elevation angle in the front median plane. The simulation was then repeated 1784 times, corresponding to every unique, single-voxel perturbation of the pinna's outer surface geometry. All perturbed PRTFs were compared with the baseline set, in order to precisely quantify the frequency shifts in all the spectral peaks and notches up to 14 kHz. This paper focuses on the pinna sensitivity patterns for the first spectral notch N1, known to be an auditory cue to elevation in the median plane. In particular, N1 sensitivity patterns revealed the elevation dependence of broad areas of the pinna's upper structures that are involved in reflection, and the role of the tragus region involved in diffraction.},
